## Caching

In this project, I learnt about different caching algorithms.

Caching systems are crucial in ensuring performance and efficiency of applications are enhanced. It uses caching algorithms (replacement policies) to manage the cache (high speed, low latency storage space).

The learning goals of this project are:
- What a caching system is
- What FIFO means
- What LIFO means
- What LRU means
- What MRU means
- What LFU means
- What the purpose of a caching system
- What limits a caching system have
